      Description: |
        Package github.com/moov-io/irs implements a file reader and writer written in Go along with a HTTP API and 
        CLI for creating, parsing, validating, and transforming IRS electronic Filing Information Returns 
        Electronically (FIRE). FIRE operates on a byte(ASCII) level making it difficult to interface with JSON and 
        CSV/TEXT file formats.
