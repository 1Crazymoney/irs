Package github.com/moov-io/irs implements a file reader and writer written in Go along with a HTTP API and CLI for creating, parsing, validating, and transforming IRS electronic Filing Information Returns Electronically (FIRE). FIRE operates on a byte(ASCII) level making it difficult to interface with JSON and CSV/TEXT file formats.

- [Filing Information Returns Electronically (FIRE)](https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/filing-information-returns-electronically-fire)
- File formats are defined by Part C of [IRS Publication 1220](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1220.pdf)
